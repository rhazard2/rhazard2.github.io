        <h1>My Dog Oreo</h1>
        
        <h3>My name is Robin Hazard. On this page I will be talking about my <em>childhood pet</em>, Oreo.</h3>
        
        <p class="intro">My dog Oreo is the love of my life. He is a very small, 10lb, irish pied havanese dog who was born on July 31st, 2011, and has been by my side for the last 11 years. He is cute, soft, and sassy, but also intelligent and caring. He is a very comforting animal. He always manages to cheer me up and give me a reassuring lick me when I'm sad. To be honest, he is rather self-absorbed. Everything has to be about <strong>him him him</strong> and he gets bothered when my family's attention is elsewhere. Regardless, he is a great dog and I can't wait to make more memories with him.<br><br>As a puppy, he loved to dig holes and jump up to play with leaves in my hand. I once hid a piece of ham from him in my snowy backyard, and to this day he still checks the same spot. One thing he has always disliked is his harness. He runs away everytime he sees me bringing it out.<br><br><strong><em><a href="https://havanasilkdog.org/" target="_blank">Click Here</a></em> if you want to know more about this breed.</strong></p>
